This repository aims to contain a complete
[JSON schema](http://json-schema.org) definition of the
[XING API](https://dev.xing.com/docs/resources) along with test-data.

It also contains a documentation generator that takes the schema and
renders it based the `example` JSON schema addition.

The schema files can be checked against the fixture files by executing
the `validation.rb` file. It has some dependencies, that can be
installed by running [Bundler](http://bundler.io/).  There is a Makefile that automates
this.

    bundle install
    make

The documentation can be generated by executing the `make doc`
task. This will generate the `doc.html` file.

    make doc

This repository is heavily inspired by the
[Balanced API Specification repository](https://github.com/balanced/balanced-api). Thank
you for providing this inspiring resource publicly!
